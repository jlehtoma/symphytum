<h2>WARNING: Please create a backup (File->Backup) before upgrading to be on the safe side.</h2>
<h2>WARNING: Dropbox users please read the following:</h2>
<p>
With the migration to the Dropbox API v2 (since v2.1) the old access token (Dropbox v1 API) is recognized as invalid and an error is shown "Internal Server Error".

As a workaround it is necessary to disable the cloud sync from the settings (Menu->Tools->Settings->Cloud Sync-> change status to "disabled"). 
Then restart symphytum and start the sync process over again.</p>
