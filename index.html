<li>Fields are not just text. Design your input forms with support for different data types: text, numeric, date, progress, image, file list, checkbox, combobox, etc.</li>

<li>Integrated Cloud Sync. Using Symphytum across multiple computers is a joy. Your data is always automatically synchronized everywhere. Drivers for cloud services such as Dropbox are included.</li>
<li>Sync Conflict Management. Symphytum manages synchronization conflicts for you. While only one session with write access is allowed at the same time, other computers may access the database in read-only mode during an open session.</li>
<li>Date Reminder. Date fields keep you informed on tasks, appointments or birthdays, if requested. All Reminders, once triggered, are listed in one place.</li>

<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h2>

<h3>
<a name="the-technology" class="anchor" href="#the-technology"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Technology</h3>

<p>Symphytum hides the complexity of a database engine behind an easy and intuitive user interface. The underlying database is provided by the SQLite database management system, which is the leading embedded database solution, used in many mobile apps and modern computer programs, like web browsers, media players and email clients.    </p>

<p>SQLite is tiny, efficient and very fast. It can handle huge amount of data while being highly resistant to data corruption.      </p>

<h3>
<a name="first-steps" class="anchor" href="#first-steps"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a new collection.</li>
<li>Collections group your structured data together.</li>
<li>Before you begin to enter data, you need to define at least one input field.</li>
<li>Input fields have a data type (text, numeric, image...) and delineate how data is presented and inserted.</li>
<li>You can add an unlimited amount of fields.</li>
<li>The structure of a collection can be modified at any time.</li>
<li>Once the data structure is defined, you can start to add as many records as you wish.</li>
<li>Records are data entries of your collection, they can be modified, deleted and duplicated.<br>
</li>
